client_well_details table in SQL
CREATE TABLE client_well_details (
  car_no VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  project_type VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  client VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  location VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  non_conformity VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,

Meeting minutes / to-do (20/9/24)
- For edit-car.php, fix and add and retrieve the already existing info and data into the file's input field
- Users might press back to go to different pages. For example, when on client/well page, 
  pressing back leads to new-car.php AND NOT edit-car.php, where it should be the other way around.
- So make sure that when users have submitted on new-car.php page, the operation on clicking "back" on the client-well-info.php
  has to lead back to edit-car.php?car_no=CAR-XXXXXXXX-XXXXXX
- In corrective-action-report.php, change the Client name to UZMA Division
- When the user is in editing mode, remove the proceed button to an update button with respective SQL query to update the table
